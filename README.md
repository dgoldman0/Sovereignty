# Sovereignty

The Sovereignty system is a culmination of years of work on designing a blockchain based economy and political system. It relies heavily on existing economic and political theory.

## Resource Token

The resource token is a core token of a sovereignty. This token is used to distribute a universal basic income to citizens of the sovereignty, as a fee token for certain activities and such as applying for citizenship and filing disputes against other citizens.

The resource token also functions as a base material for other tokens (narrow currencies) that are used by various foundations that support the citizens of the sovereignty.

### Governance

Citizens will be able to vote on various matters, such as selecting individuals that can make day to day decisions about the rate of UBI distribution and other factors. They can also submit propositions for more direct actions.

## UBI

While there was a time when it may have been necessary for people to work in order to afford even basic necessities, we are past that point. Technology has made it inexpensive to produce enough basic resources to supply people with what they need.

Universal basic income gives people a foundation which ensures that people can afford what they need, without having to worry about whether they can find work.

Under the UBI system, a certain amount of resource token added to the supply every day, and distributed among citizens.

### Extended Income

Aside from the basic income system, foundations will provide their own narrow currency to people who complete certain tasks, such as learning, and volunteering to teach, important skills that can help them and others in society. This system creates an extended income system on top of the basic income system.

## Trust

Every citizen has a certain amount of trust. Citizens of a sovereignty can build up trust in a variety of ways. Transferring funds to another citizen builds trust, but decreases the amount of UBI received by an equal amount.

Trust cannot be transferred directly. Instead, it acts as means of resolving disputes. When a claim against another citizen is resolved, and the citizen is deemed to owe funds towards the claim, that citizen's trust is decreased by that amount, more resource tokens are minted, and those new tokens are distributed to the plaintiff.

Trust cannot be negative, so at most a person can only be required to pay as much as they have in trust. Moreover, because trust is not the same as their balance of the resource token, the defendant does not directly lose any funds.

### Arbitration

Disputes will be resolved by selecting arbiters and allowing them to decide the outcome of the case. Arbiters can only work within the confines of a case presented to them.

## Narrow Currencies

As already mentioned, the resource token for a sovereignty can be used to produce narrow currencies through various foundations. This process uses a modified ERC20 system, where a person can register as a smith, and pay a certain amount of resource tokens, in return for minting more of the narrow currency.

Most of the resource tokens spent goes to the foundation, to help fund their efforts, but part of the funds are also sent to the UBI distribution system, so that as more narrow currency is minted, more funds are distributed back to the citizens as a whole.

## BASICS Foundation

The goal is to establish an initial foundation which handles basic needs, such as food, clothing, and shelter.

### Support for Producers

BASICS Foundation will support farmers, clothing manufacturers, home goods suppliers, and other similar entities, through commodity streaming.

The idea of commodity streaming is not new. But streaming is generally limited to precious metals and similar industries. Streaming is a lot like a loan. A precious metals streaming company will fund a mining operation.

But instead of asking for interest and loan repayment, a contract is established which allows the streaming company to buy the metals at a certain fixed price, which is generally expected to be significantly below the current market price of the metal. In this way, streaming is a cross between a loan and a futures contract.

BASICS Foundation will use the same approach, but instead of giving funding to mining operations, it'll give funding to companies that produce basic necessities. The foundation will then buy these products at a discount, and distribute some of these resources to those in need, as care packages.

#### BASICS Boxes

In addition to care packages, BASICS Foundation will also offer subscription boxes, which can be purchased in the foundation's narrow currency (BSIC). Some of the narrow currency will be burned to support its purchasing power, while the rest will go back to the foundation to help it cover expenses.
